# README

We made an app that will show photos of SUV's that we like.
<---screenshot here --->

We used a clone of Imgur called Photo_app, from a project designed to help people learn Ruby on Rails.  It is the medium difficulty project. Here is the link:
    https://github.com/wyncode/student-resources/tree/master/trio-project




Please ensure that you have Ruby 3.0.0 on your machine and Rails
Here is how to check:

    ```bash
    ruby -v
    sqlite3 -v
    node -v
    yarn -v
    ```
    
If you need to install Rails:

  ```bash
  gem install rails
  rails -v
  ```
  
This is how to run the test suite

Clone the file at https://github.com/Gus-Meyer/GroupProject
or 
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Gus-Meyer/GroupProject
  cd photo_app
  ```
Then create the database:
  ```bash
  rails db:create
  rails db:migrate
  rails db:seed
  ```
Next, start up the web server:
  ```bash
  rails s
  ```
Now open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

Going forward with this project, we would like to add a 'like' button, but we haven't figured that out, yet.
